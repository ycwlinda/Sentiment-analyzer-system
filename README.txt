This is Project 2 extra credits description.

Extra credits:
1. We produce the ROC curves for OUR classifiers and compute the Area Under the Curve for each one, by using the labeled test set which is split when training the classifier.
And the result is roc score for pos is 0.727, for neg is 0.798, the roc curve plots are shown in the report.


2. We calculate the positive and negative percentage with title containing "trump" and make comparison with all the comments.
The positive percentage of reddits with a title including trump is 0.2975206611570248. The negative percentage of reddits with a title including trump is 0.8394787031150668. Compared to the positive percentage and negative percentage of the whole reddits. Reddits whose title include trump is slightly more positive than the average.
