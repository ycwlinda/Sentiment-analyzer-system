# CS 143 project

We built a sentiment analyzer that parses a Reddit comment and returns a list containing formatted strings for analysis.

Used PySpark to model comment sentiments in r/politics and trained a Logistic Regression model with different criteria.

- reddit_model.py is the main program.

- analysis.py was used to analyze and visualize results.
